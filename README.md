# Nearest City Finder

A command-line tool and web application that finds the closest city by driving distance within a specified radius using the Google Maps API.

## Features

- Finds the nearest city from a list of cities based on actual driving distance
- Filters cities by linear distance first to optimize API usage
- Supports custom radius limits
- Deduplicates city entries automatically
- Shows both linear and driving distances for better comparison
- Web interface for interactive city searching
- Search history tracking
- Interactive map visualization

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Maps API key with the following APIs enabled:
  - Geocoding API
  - Distance Matrix API

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarkoPoloResearchLab/NearestCityFinder.git
cd NearestCityFinder
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install googlemaps flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-migrate psycopg2-binary
```

3. Set up environment variables:

export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
export DATABASE_URL='your_postgres_database_url'
```

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
python city_finder.py -f cities.txt -c "San Francisco" -r 300
```

Arguments:
- `-f, --file`: Path to text file containing list of cities (one city per line)
- `-c, --city`: Anchor city to measure distances from
- `-r, --radius`: Maximum radius in miles to consider cities

### Web Application
```bash
